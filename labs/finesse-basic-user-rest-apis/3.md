## Step 3: Sign in the user to Finesse

> Finesse API for signing in a user
>  ```http
http://64.103.26.58:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}
```
> For more details, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S21A5A70_00_sign-in.html" target="_blank">User - Sign In to Finesse</a>

Signing in the user uses the same ``/User`` REST resource, but this time via the HTTP **PUT** verb. In addition, we need to prove some extra information about the user (i.e. state and extension), represented as XML data in the request Body:
```xml
<User>
   <state>LOGIN</state>
   <extension>[the extension assigned to the user]</extension>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab. As suggested in the previous step, it is not recommended to click the Reset button.
2. Construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource with the same {id} as **Step 2: Get the user information section**
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **PUT** is selected
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password appears.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter the id that was used in the ``/User`` resource
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter the password of the user from the ``/User`` resource
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu
 * In the large body text box, paste the XML user data as shown above. Change the value of the extension tag to the extension found in the yellow overlay bar at the bottom of the screen.

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request
4. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty Body textbox

5. To confirm that the user was logged in successfully, use the GET user API from the **Step 2: Get the user information section** and verify that the ``<state>`` tag value is NOT_READY. If you kept the tab from Step 2 opened, switch back to that tab and click the **Send** button.
